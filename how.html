    <p>Watch and listen how the buttons flash on screen. You have to press buttons in same order. For level 1, one button will flash. Press the same button to go to level 2. Again, 1 button will flash. But this time you have to press previous button first and then the new button. Try to remember the order in every level. As level increases, difficulty also increases.
    Play well. All the best!</p>
